// P34's playout labeller: positions labelled by greedy playouts to the game's end.
//
// Each queued position is dealt into `worlds` worlds from its mover's view (rollout::determinize),
// each with fresh dice, and every world is played to the end by the caller's network on both sides
// -- fill_live() -> logits -> step() -- through the safe-playout rule of
// ai/eval/paired_playouts.play_safe: while the position's own action round lasts and its mover
// decides, at DEFCON 2 or below, no option that loses on the spot is taken while another exists.
// What each world records, from the mover's side: the score (1 / 0.5 / 0), the VP track at the end,
// the VP track and DEFCON as the position's turn ends (at the end, if the game ends first), and
// each region's swing at its next scoring (ts::ScoringTap; masked where it is never scored).
//
// A position queued with candidates (the sibling slice) plays each candidate in the same worlds,
// on the same dice, and also keeps each row's leaf: the first position after the candidate at
// which the mover decides again (or, with leaf_horizon > 0, the first after that many action-round
// boundaries or the turn's end, whichever is sooner -- the rollout root's stop=earlier, leaf=own).
//
// Batching is continuous: a finished world frees its row at once, and the next queued position
// fills the free rows, so the network always sees a full batch. A position's worlds are drawn from
// a stream seeded by (seed, id), so its labels do not depend on what else shared the batch.
// Native only: the browser has no use for it.
