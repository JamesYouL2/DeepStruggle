namespace ts {

// A GameState that keeps its own flat legal mask, for the containers that own their states and ask
// for that mask over and over: the C++ search tree and the batch runner.
//
// Why: the mask was built three times for every position a search reached -- StateMachine::step
// regenerates it to validate the action it is given, auto-advance generates it to look for a
// forced move, and the search generates it again for the network -- 3.27 times a leaf, ~20% of
// the leaf's CPU. Kept here, it is generated once per position and every later use reads it.
//
// The guarantee is structural. The state is private: reading it is `state()`, a const reference,
// and the ONLY way to a mutable one is `modify(f)`, which marks the cache invalid before f runs
// and again after. step / step_flat / auto_advance go through modify too. So no code outside this
// class can change the state without invalidating the cache -- a write that skipped it would not
// compile. The engine's own rules code (StateMachine, the event handlers) keeps taking a plain
// GameState&, and only ever runs inside one of those calls.
//
// The one write that does not invalidate is `set_rng`: the mask does not depend on the RNG state
// (engine test CachedState.MaskIgnoresRngAndLastRolls), and it is what lets a search child be
// validated against its parent's mask.
//
// Checked, not only argued: with set_mask_cache_checks(true) -- on in the engine tests, the
// fuzzers and the whole Python test suite -- every read of a cached mask regenerates it and aborts
// if the two differ. Python's GameState is the plain struct and has no cache, so nothing Python
// writes can leave one stale.
