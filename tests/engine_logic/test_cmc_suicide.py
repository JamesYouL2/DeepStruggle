"""Couping under Cuban Missile Crisis is a self-inflicted loss, and must be reported as one.

The engine ends a CMC coup at +/-20 VP and deliberately leaves DEFCON alone -- it is a
Cuban Missile Crisis loss, not a thermonuclear one. From the outside that is
indistinguishable from a legitimate 20 VP win: same victory_points, same GAME_OVER, DEFCON
untouched. Every consumer that keyed off ``defcon <= 1`` therefore missed it:

* the ending classifier reported "20 VP", understating self-inflicted losses;
* the training env never set defcon_blunder, so blunder windowing did not apply;
* the behavioural statistics inherited both errors.

CMC_SUICIDE_LOSS records it at the point of resolution, which is the only place that knows.
