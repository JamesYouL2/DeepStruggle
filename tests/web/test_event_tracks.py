"""The page's action log says what each event of a click did to VP and DEFCON.

The second headline commit resolves both headlines in one engine step, and the log described a
click by comparing the state before and after it. At turn 8's headline of the workbench game
nuclear_test_ban, Nuclear Test Ban gave the US 1 VP (DEFCON 3) and Pershing II gave the USSR 1 VP:
the score did not move, and the log said nothing of either. The engine now records each event's
own change (GameState::last_event_tracks) and the log words them when the sum cannot.
