"""Checkpoint Inspector: lists checkpoints with their size, date and architecture.

    PYTHONPATH=.:build/release python tools/inspect_checkpoints.py [directory]

The directory defaults to the shared data tree's `checkpoints/` (tools/lib/data_root.py). The
architecture is the one the evaluation loader builds from the weights
(`tools.lib.player_agent.NeuralAgent`), so this listing cannot disagree with what a tournament
would run. Each checkpoint is loaded in full, on the CPU. `resume_*.pt` files are training state,
not policies, and are listed without one. A file that fails to load is listed with its error and
makes the command exit 1.
