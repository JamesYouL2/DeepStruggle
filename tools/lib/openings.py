"""Named opening setups that can be forced on an agent in place of its own placements.

A trained policy fights where it was placed and rarely opens a new front, so its own setup
decides much of what the rest of the game can look like. Forcing a known opening is how that gets
separated: same agent, same engine, different starting board.

One definition, used by both the probe that measures the effect (`ai/eval/forced_setup.py`) and
the replay generators that produce games to watch (`tools/lib/self_play.py`,
`tools/play_match.py`). If these drifted, a replay labelled "the human opening" would not be the
opening the numbers were measured on.
