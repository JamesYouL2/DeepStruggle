/**
 * What the other side's latest turn did to the map, for a player's view: the countries whose
 * influence it changed, and the ones it targeted (a failed coup or a realignment that moved
 * nothing still matters).
 *
 * A "turn" is a run of steps that share a turn, phase, action round and owner. The owner is the
 * phasing player -- whose action round it is, which includes the other side's decisions inside it
 * (an opponent's event triggered by the card) -- except at setup, where each side places its own.
 * During the headline the engine makes each event's owner the phasing player while it resolves,
 * so a headline event is its owner's turn; choosing the headline card changes nothing on the map
 * and is not a turn.
 *
 * Everything here is public: the map, and which country a move named.
