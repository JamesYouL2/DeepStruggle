/**
 * A game as the stats database keeps it (stats.ts submits it, tools/game_stats.py reads it).
 *
 * Two parts. The moves: every step's MicroAction and forced die, from the seed (or a loaded
 * position) -- enough to re-drive the game in the engine of the build's commit, so the full
 * .tslog.json is rebuilt offline rather than sent (a few KB here against MBs). And how each move
 * was made: by whom (a click, the model's suggestion played by the human, or auto-play), whether
 * the model's readout was on screen for it, and the settings in force -- view, auto side, model,
 * search -- so a game in which the human moved for the model, saw its hand in the Developer view,
 * took hints, forced a die or switched models can be told from a straight game against one
 * player. Nothing is refused: everything is recorded, and the reader filters.
 *
 * The settings travel per step, not as a timeline of changes: undo cuts the steps back, and a
 * timeline would then say the wrong setting for the steps played again.
 *
 * The log's bytes (LOG_VERSION 1), little-endian, zlib-deflated, base64url without padding:
 *   u8 version, u32 seed, u32 step count, then per step 7 bytes:
 *   decision_type, primary_id, secondary_id, flags, forced die (0 = rolled), info, setting index
 *   info: bits 0-1 source (0 human, 1 suggested, 2 auto), bit 2 readout on screen,
 *         bits 3-4 mover (0 none, 1 US, 2 USSR), bit 5 the step rolled a die.
 * tools/lib/game_stats.py reads the same bytes; summarize() and its summarize() must agree.
